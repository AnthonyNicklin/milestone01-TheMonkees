# The Monkees #
## Frontend Webdevelopment Project ##


## Aim ##

The aim of this project was to create and build a front-end only website that has 4-5 pages for the rock band [The Monkees](https://anthonynicklin.github.io/milestone01-TheMonkees/). I was
provided with material such as audio and a video clip which they wanted fans to be able to play on their website. Other assests they provided where photos of the band, album covers and indivual band member photos. 

## UX ##

Starting with a mobile first desgin approach to this project I started creating wireframes for mobile and small screens. I then moved onto creating mockups for medium and desktop/larger screens. 

The main desgin of the site is clean, simple but also funky. I kept to a simple color scheme in keeping with the main background image that I choose to use. Having a clean cut desgin, I felt makes it easier for the fan to read and use the website.

The navigation bar is responsive having break points for smaller and medium size screens. At these breaks points a burgar menu appears top right, and when clicked brings a drop down menu with the navigation links. The 'Home' link is displayed in the navigation bar when the drop down menu is collapsed in order bring the fan back to the home page with just one click without having to toggle the drop down menu. 

The layout of the media.html and meet-the-band.html have been kept simular in order to give the website consistency. 

Below are user stories that were conducted in order to gain clear goals that needed to be achieved for this website.
1. As a fan I wanted to listen to current and back catalogue tracks.
2. As a fan I wanted to see where and when the band will be preforming.
2. As a fan I wanted to be able to find and book tickets to the bands next gigs.
3. As a fan I wanted to read intresting facts about the band and about each artist.
4. As an event promoter I wanted to hear and preview their tracks.
5. As an event promoter I wanted to see a promotional video of the band.
6. As an event promoter I wanted a way in which I could contact the band for bookings.
7. As an fan I wanted to be able to contact the band to book for my own event.
8. As an event promoter I wanted to check out their soical media via links.
9. As a fan I wanted links to their differnt soical media pages on different platforms.
