## Aim ##
The aim of this project was to create and build a front-end only website 4-5 pages for a rock "The Monkees". I was
provided with material such as audio and a video clip which they wanted fans to be able to play on their website. Other assests they provided where photos of the band, album covers and indivual band member photos. 

## UX ##

***

Starting with a mobile first desgin approach to this project I started creating wireframes for mobile and small screens. I then moved onto creating mockups for medium and desktop/larger screens. 

The main desgin of the site is clean, simple but also funky. I kept to a simple color scheme of white and red with text in a lighter shade of black. Having a clean cut desgin, I felt makes it easier for the fan to read and use the website.

The navigation bar is responsive having break points for smaller and medium size screens. At these breaks points a burgar menu appears top right, and when clicked brings a drop down menu with the navigation links. The 'Home' link is displayed in the navigation bar when the drop down menu is collapsed in order bring the fan back to the home page with just one click without having to toggle the drop down menu. 

The layout of the media.html and meet-the-band.html have been kept simplier in order to give the website consistency. This makes it easier for the fan to follow and take in the content being displayed on each page. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
1. As a fan I wanted to listen to current and back catalogue tracks.
2. As a fan I wanted to see where and when the band will be preforming.
2. As a fan I wanted to be able to find and book tickets to the bands next gigs.
3. As a fan I wanted to read intresting facts about the band and about each artist.
4. As an event promoter I wanted to heard and preview their tracks.
5. As an event promoter I wanted to see a promotional video of the band.
6. As an event promoter I wanted a way in which I could contact the band for bookings
7. As an fan I wanted to be to contact the band to book for my own event.
8. As an event promoter I wanted to check out their soical media via links.
9. As a fan I wanted links to their differnt soical media pages on different platforms
