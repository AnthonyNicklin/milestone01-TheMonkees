# The Monkees #
## Front-end Web Development Project ##


## Aim ##

The aim of this project was to create and build a front-end only website that has 4-5 pages for the rock band [The Monkees](https://anthonynicklin.github.io/milestone01-TheMonkees/). 
I was provided with content to use which included a video and audio tracks which they wanted fans to be able to play on their website. Other assets they provided where photos of 
the band, album covers and individual band member photos. 

## UX ##

Starting with a mobile first design approach to this project I started creating wireframes for mobile and small screens. I then moved onto creating mockups 
for medium and larger screens. The design of the site is clean, simple but funky in keeping with the 60's style the band has. I kept to a simple color scheme 
in keeping with the main background image that I chose to use. Having a clean cut design, I feel makes it easier for the fan to read and use the website.

Below are user stories that were conducted in order to gain clear goals that needed to be achieved for this website.
1. As a fan I wanted to listen to current and back catalogue tracks.
2. As a fan I wanted to see where and when the band will be preforming.
2. As a fan I wanted to be able to find and book tickets to the bands next gigs.
3. As a fan I wanted to read intresting facts about the band and about each artist.
4. As an event promoter I wanted to hear and preview their tracks.
5. As an event promoter I wanted to see a promotional video of the band.
6. As an event promoter I wanted a way in which I could contact the band for bookings.
7. As an fan I wanted to be able to contact the band to book for my own event.
8. As an event promoter I wanted to check out their soical media via links.
9. As a fan I wanted links to their differnt social media pages on different platforms.

The navigation bar is responsive having break points for smaller, medium and large screens. At these breaks points a burgar menu appears top right, and when 
clicked brings a drop down menu with the navigation links. The bands logo continues to be displayed in the navigation bar when the navigation bar is collapsed  
and provides a way back to the home page when clicked on without having to toggle the drop down menu. 

The [Home page](https://anthonynicklin.github.io/milestone01-TheMonkees/) has a great picture of the band performing and has been put as the first image the visitor sees
when visiting the website in order to attract the fan to attend one of the bands gigs. Under the bands image is the [Live Dates](https://milestone-project-01-anthonynicklin.c9users.io/index.html#live-dates)
section which provides a easily way to find tickets using the Find Ticket buttons next to each upcoming live date. The [Book Us](https://milestone-project-01-anthonynicklin.c9users.io/index.html#book-us) section
provides fans or promoters with a way to contact the band in order to book them with a neatly laid out and easy to use form.

As soon as the visitor hits the [Media](https://milestone-project-01-anthonynicklin.c9users.io/media.html) page a promation video hits them of the band playing. This is
used to encourage the fan to see the band play live. Underneath is a neat section of album tracks with cover images and controls to play a track from each one. Content is provided
next to each album to give the visitor a bit of intrest about that album the band is promoting. 

[Meet the Band](https://milestone-project-01-anthonynicklin.c9users.io/meet-the-band.html) uses a simple layout so the fan can easly read information about the band and then about
each individual member. 

During the process of developying the site I found that the layout on the [Media](https://milestone-project-01-anthonynicklin.c9users.io/media.html) and [Meet the Band](https://milestone-project-01-anthonynicklin.c9users.io/meet-the-band.html) 
pages did not look great across all devices. I decided to change the layout and reposition images and content but, still keeping the design theme consistent. These pages now look much 
more appealing across all screens sizes and devices giving a better user experience than sicking with the orignal layout in the orignal wireframes.

## Features ##

Features on this website are:

* On every screen size the logo of the band is presented and is also a link to the [home page](https://anthonynicklin.github.io/milestone01-TheMonkees/)

I reached out to fellow students on Slack to view my website and test. A lead mentor found a major problem with the responsive
aspect of the website. Even tho the website looked correct on small devices, when adjusting a web browser on a desktop below 400px there was huge
overflow. This pointed out I had not applied the mobile first approach correclty. I did more research on mobile first design and implementation and went 
back over notes and lessons. To correct the fault I had to rewrite 60% of my style.css. 


## Deployment ##

The website was created using Cloud9 IDE using Ubuntu with BASH. Git was used for version control and pushed to a repository hosted on 
[GITHUB](https://github.com).

The website is deployed using GitHub pages [The Monkees](https://anthonynicklin.github.io/milestone01-TheMonkees/)
